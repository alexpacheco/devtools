# Virtualization

.pull-left[
* Virtualization is “the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something” (Wikipedia)

* So that multiple applications (that have different dependencies) can share the hardware resources on one physical computer

| Virtual Machines | Containers |
|:------:|:----|
| Very flexible, e.g. one can run a Windows guest OS on Linux or vice versa  | Less flexible |
| Heavyweight, need to install all files of a guest OS | Very lightweight, will use the kernel of the host OS |

# Containers

* Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. 

* Containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer’s personal laptop. 

* Containerization allows development teams to move fast, deploy software efficiently, and operate at an unprecedented scale.

* Definition
   * Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and libraries required to run your software services.

# Benefits of Containers

* Less overhead
  - Containers require less system resources than traditional or hardware virtual machine environments because they don’t include operating system images.
* Increased portability
  - Applications running in containers can be deployed easily to multiple different operating systems and hardware platforms.
* More consistent operation
  - DevOps teams know applications in containers will run the same, regardless of where they are deployed.
* Greater efficiency
  - Containers allow applications to be more rapidly deployed, patched, or scaled.
* Better application development
  - Containers support agile and DevOps efforts to accelerate development, test, and production cycles.

# Container use cases

* Agile development

  - Containers allow your developers to move much more quickly by avoiding concerns about dependencies and environments.

* Efficient operations

  - Containers are lightweight and allow you to use just the computing resources you need. This lets you run your applications efficiently.

* Run anywhere

  - Containers are able to run virtually anywhere. Wherever you want to run your software, you can use containers.

# What is Docker?

.pull-left[
* open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications
* enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly
* Use cases:
   - Fast, consistent delivery of your applications
   - Responsive deployment and scaling
   - Running more workloads on the same hardware
]

.pull-right[
* uses a client-server architecture
   - client talks to the daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your containers

# Why Containers in HPC?

* Some applications are very hard to install:
   * Complex dependencies that is cumbersome even for SPACK.
   * Developers are too lazy to test on various architecture and distributions:
       * How many of you use an application that  _works or is tested only on Ubuntu 14.04_?
       * Provide docker images since supporting an application takes time away from doing research.

* Reproducibility is not always guaranteed

* Difficult to share workflows, pipelines and environments with colleagues

<!--
* Can we just use docker?
   * NO. Docker has two major issues with running on HPC systems.
       * Docker requires you to run as root that is not permitted on shared resources such as HPC systems.
       * Docker is not designed to run on HPC systems. It is not designed to run mpi applications across multiple nodes 
-->
  

---

# What is Singularity?

* open-source container software that allows users to pack an application and all of its dependencies into a single image (file)

* "Container for HPC"
  - Assumes that the user does not have root privileges on the host OS
  - Other HPC Container systems:  Charliecloud, Shifter

* Native command line interface
   * Syntax: `singularity <command> <options> <arguments>`

* Can use docker images as well as it's own .sif images.

* Can run mpi applications provided the version of the mpi on the host and the container are the same.

# Singularity Basics

*  Command Line syntax:
  ```{bash eval=F}
  singularity <command> <options> <arguments>
  ```

* To get help information for a specific command:
  ```{bash eval=F}
  singularity <command> --help
  ```

* Privilege Escalation
  * If you do not have root privileges outside the container, you do not have them inside the container either.
  * Need to build images on your local computer (where you have root privileges)


---

# Singularity Workflow

* Build Singularity images on the local machine
  - Root privilege is needed
* Upload images onto the HPC cluster
* Run containers on the HPC cluster
  - Root privilege is NOT needed

# Installing Singularity
* On Linux
  - Install binary (recommended)
     * Use either apt-get or rpm/yum or zypper

  -  Install from source
     * https://github.com/sylabs/singularity

* On Windows
  - Install a Linux VM or WSL first

* On Mac
  - Install a Linux VM or Vagrant first


---

# Download images from URI

* You can pull images from docker hub or another URI instead of building images

```{bash eval=F}

# Building images

* Use the `build` command to build Singularity images
  * Need root privileges
*  Syntax:
  ```{bash eval=F}
  singularity build [build options…] <image file path> <BUILD TARGET>
  ```
* Build a Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  image:
  ```{bash eval=F}
  sudo singularity build ubuntu.sif docker://ubuntu:20.04
  ```
* The `BUILD TARGET` defines the method how an image is built
  - A URI to a base OS/container image
     * Docker Hub images begins with docker://
     * Singularity Hub images begins with shub://
  - Path to a Singularity sandbox 
  - Path to a Singularity recipe (definition file)
     * More on this later


---

# Build a sandbox for modifying image

* By default, a compressed, read-only image will be built
* The `--sandbox` option builds a sandbox to which changes can be made
* To make changes to the sandbox, use the singularity shell command with the `--writable` option
     * Manage files and directories
     * Install packages/dependencies
* Example
  - Build a Ubuntu 20.04 sandboxed image
     ```{bash eval=F}
     sudo singularity build --sandbox ubuntu docker://ubuntu:20.04
     ```
  - Start a writable shell in the Ubuntu sandboxed image
     ```{bash eval=F}
     sudo singularity shell --writable ubuntu
     ```


---

# Build your own images

* The preferred method to build singularity images is by creating a definition file (similar to Dockerfile for docker images)
   * The method on the previous slide (pull image, create sandbox, install packages, create final image) is 
	 * tedious to reproduce
         * cannot set environment and other features that improve usability
* A Singularity Definition file is divided into two parts
* Header: describes the core operating system to build within the container.
   * configure the base operating system features needed. 
   * specify, the Linux distribution, the specific version, and the packages that must be part of the core install 
* Sections: rest of the definition is comprised of sections
   * Each section is defined by a `%` character followed by the name of the particular section
   * sections are optional, and a def file may contain more than one instance of a given section

---

# Definition file: Header

* The header should be written at the top of the def file. 
* It tells Singularity about the base OS used to build the container.
* `Bootstrap` (required): determines the bootstrap agent to create the base OS
   - docker (images hosted on Docker Hub)
   - localimage (images saved on your machine)
   - docker-daemon (images managed by the locally running docker daemon)
   - yum/zypper/debootstrap (yum/zypper based systems such as CentOS/OpenSUSE/Debian,Ubuntu)
* Depending on the value assigned to `Bootstrap`, other keywords may also be valid in the header

```{bash eval=F}
Bootstrap: docker
From: debian:7

Bootstrap: localimage
From: /path/to/container/file/or/directory

Bootstrap: docker-daemon
From: debian:latest

Bootstrap: yum
OSVersion: 7
MirrorURL: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/
Include: yum
```

# Getting Base OS/Container Images

* Repositories

   - Docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/

   - NVIDIA GPU Cloud: https://ngc.nvidia.com
 
   - QUAY: https://quay.io

   - Distribution repo
  
        * YUM/RHEL
  
        * Debian/Ubuntu


* See `singularity build --help`
   

---


# Definition file: Section

* sections add different content or execute commands at different times during the build process
* Common sections
   * `%setup`: commands in the %setup section are first executed on the host system outside of the container after the base OS has been installed 
   * `%files` : copy files into the container with greater safety than using the %setup section
   * `%post`: commmands to be executed on the container image for e.g. download files from the internet, install new software and libraries, write configuration files, create new directories, etc.
   * `%environment`: define environment variables that will be set at runtime
   * `%runscript`: command to be executed when the container image is run
   * `%labels`: add metadata to your container
   * `%help`: add metadata to display message  using the `run-help` command 
   * `%app*`: if you build multiple applications within the same container, you can create run, help and env sections for individual apps

# Singularity on Sol and Hawk

* Singularity is installed on all compute nodes of Sol and Hawk.
    * There is no module file for singularity

* Singularity containers available for
    * Virtual Desktop Environment on Open OnDemand
    * RStudio Server on Open OnDemand
    * Cactus uses singularity to run docker image 
    
* Want to use your image:
    * You need to build on your local system and copy the .sif file to Sol

# Best Practices

* Bootstrap from trusted sources
    * preferably use base image from docker hub provided by OS vendor.
    * avoid using an image from some random source.
    * if you need to use a random source, review the dockerfile, definition file etc first.

* Try to reuse existing images
    * See my rstudio images. (https://github.com/alexpacheco/lurc-ood-rstudio)
       * build base image with minimal packages ->
       * image with dependencies for installing a set of basic R packages ->
       * image with R packages for bioinformatics or geospatial

* If possible, build docker images, upload to docker hub and bootstrap docker images (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/alexpacheco/rstudio)
    * docker builds images in layers and it is easier to build a singularity image by downloading various layers.
